# Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description

This repository contains description files and meshes for *Universal Robots* manipulators.

The UR10e is a 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) collaborative robotic manipulator, offering a maximum reach of 1300 mm. Its six revolute joints provide high flexibility and dexterity, enabling precise positioning and orientation in complex industrial automation tasks.

The UR10e is modified with a vertical prismatic lift with a range of 1 meter in the z-axis enabling it to reach points in a 3D workspace.
The modified urdf is stored as [lifted_ur.urdf.xacro](./urdf/lifted_ur.urdf.xacro). and [lifted_ur.urdf](./urdf/lifted_ur.urdf).
